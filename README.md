# How to use Skyflow and save or import a project?

Important Info: All images on the site must be links accessable online. You can esaly achieve this by first uploading any image assets your design my require to [Skynet](https://siasky.net/) first. You will see once you get started.

1. [Go to](http://skyflow.kco.hns.to/) the live Skyflow site and start creating a project.
2. When you are ready to stop or "save" your document click the small pen icon labled "import"
3. Then click on "Save as .gram file"
4. Keep your downloaded .gram file safe as it contains your latest site edits
5. To load your most recent edits back into Skyflow you simply need to click on "Load .gram file in the same "import section".

# How to export a completed project?

1. Make sure to also export your .gram file as well before exporting the final static site. This way you can always go back and update your project using the .gram file.
2. To export the final project as a static site with an index.html file you simply click on the "Download as zip" button.

# Whats next? 

Once you have your site design as an exported zip you can now easily host it on [Skynet](https://siasky.net/) by unzipping the directory and uploading as a Directory or Web App to Skynet.

You can also setup your own Handshake domain name and Skynet resolverlinks if you would like. Links to more information is below.

# Roadmap

I am not a programer so there is really no way for me to create any of these things yet. But, I would like to see the following.

1. Builtin "Deploy to Skynet" integration rather than the current Netlify option.
2. The ability to save your .gram file to your own MySky storage space.
3. The ability to have and edit multiple site pages 

----

You can use the site directly by visiting http://skyflow.kco.hns.to/

or

You can add to your own Skynet Homescreen by clicking the button below.
